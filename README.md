This repository contains code for **Official implementation** of the following paper:

Xiong, Bo, et al. "Real-time parameter evaluation of high-speed microfluidic droplets using continuous spike streams." Proceedings of the 32nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia. 2024.

## Contents

- `sim_calculate_parameters.ipynb`: Calculating parameters for simulation data. The simulation data can be download from [SpikeSimulationData](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1uVMRjsNW2gbXUnkimBWdlw?pwd=keeq)

- The real experimental data *(coming soon)*


## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed
2. Open `sim_calculate_parameters.ipynb` to analyze and calculate parameters. The paths to the dataset and output files should be specified.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (listed in notebook)
